# Acton University Un-Cancel Drupal 6 Module

This is the custom D6 module used to un-cancel participants for Acton University 2015 with a single endpoint.

Previously un-canceling users from the conference required manual role edits and content deletion.

This module is a good example of:

+ Setting multiple custom Drupal messages
+ Sending emails from a module
+ Querying Drupal to find specific node id's
+ Setting and unsetting custom Drupal roles
+ Querying Drupal to find Ubercart orders
